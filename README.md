## Important points:
**1. DEG Button**
- The `DEG` is a toggle button.
- It converts radian value to degree.
- On clicking it, you get the option to convert Radian to Degree and the button text become "RAD".

**2. 2nd Button**
- `2nd` is also a toggle button.
- On clicking it, you get a new column displayed below it, which contains more mathematical functions.

**3. F-E Button**
- It converts the value in the form of exponential number.
